Water treatment is crucial for the benefit of humans due to removing the waste particles from water using screens. Simulating fluid through a treatment process, especially in a 3D model, is a very complex task. Therefore, for simplicity, the simulation was limited to a rectangular 2D model in this article. 

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for simulating fluid flow through a simplified 2D model of water treatment screens. The Navier-Stokes equations were used to simulate the fluid flow and were discretized using backward, forward, and central finite difference methods. The boundary conditions were considered using Neumann and Dirichlet conditions.

## Methods
The simulation was done through several steps, which included defining the geometry and boundary conditions of the micro simplified model, discretizing the equations, and utilizing Matlab programming to put the numerical scheme into practice. The visualization of simulation results was done in Matlab to see the flow behavior.

## Results
The results of the simulation showed the behavior of fluid flow through a simplified database of 2D screengrid. The principles and methods used in this simulation can be applied to simulate fluid in other scenarios.

## Usage
The code in this repository can be used as a starting point for simulating fluid flow through a simplified database of 2D screengrid. The code can be adapted and modified to suit specific simulation requirements. 

## Conclusion
Overall, this article highlights the principles and numerical methods used to simulate fluid flow through water treatment screens. The results of the simulation can be used to gain a deeper understanding of fluid behavior in wastewater treatment processes, and the code in this repository can be used as an understanding of the Navier-Stokes equations and a starting point for future simulations. 

### PS: This article was made as an assesment for the Numerical Methods of Simulations course.
